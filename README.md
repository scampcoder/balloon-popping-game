# Balloon Popping Game

Honestly, this code seems kinda messy. I am following an online tutorial and hopefully can find a way to clean up the code as I learn more.

Things I learned:
* How to better select elements in CSS with (nth child)
* How to better use EventListeners
* How to better link functions to use with one another
